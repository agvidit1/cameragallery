Forum for disaster mitigation

We have observed that in case of disasters the main problem that arises is lack of information. Basically one doesn't know when and 
where the disaster is happening. Be it the one who is suffering from it or the authorities who are responsible for helping the victims.
What our app does is that it informs the public about what mishappening is occuring around them.

The apps allows the users to describe what incident is happening in their vicinity and share them in form of photos, videos or just plain 
description! The app takes the GPS location of the accident and shows it on a map in the form of markers. Clicking on the markers
opens a feed which shows the content uploaded by the witness. 

The respective authorities can also access the victims location and severity of the situation and act accordingly. They can mark the location 
of their relief and health camps. The app also features the contact numbers of all the concerned authorities.

The app extends to a forum for discussion of a particular disaster. Any user can either privately chat with the person uploading the
particulars or have an open conversation where all the victims give their responses. The authorities can also help the mass collectively by 
giving appropriate suggestions.

Last but not the least, the uploader is asked few questions (which he is allowed to skip), asking more about the situation, be it the area
affected or the type of disaster. This helps the onlooker to specifically search for a particular type of disaster or the authorities, to
tackle severe situations first.
